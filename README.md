# ⚔️ Legendary Battle Simulator 🛡️

*Legendary Battle Simulator* is a simple program designed to showcase the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It is a text-based turn-based combat simulator where players choose a character class and battle randomly generated enemies with unique stats and skills.

## ❓ What does this program do?

This program demonstrates the use of *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* concepts in Python through an engaging battle simulation. It allows users to:

* ⚔️ *Choose your character class*  
  Select from **Warrior**, **Mage**, **Archer**, or **Assassin**, each with different stats, skills, and critical hit chances.

* 🧠 *Make strategic decisions*  
  Choose whether to attack, defend, or cast spells during your turn. Manage health and mana wisely to survive.

* 🆙 *Level up after battles*  
  Gain experience, increase stats, and face stronger enemies after each victory.

* 💀 *Battle a wide range of enemies*  
  Fight against over 20 unique enemy types with scaling health and damage based on your level.

This program uses an abstract base class (`GameCharacter`) and subclasses (`Warrior`, `Mage`, `Archer`, `Assassin`) to demonstrate key OOP principles such as:

* *Inheritance*: Sharing combat behavior and stats between character types.
* *Abstraction*: Defining a blueprint for characters using abstract methods.
* *Polymorphism*: Allowing each character class to implement its own unique actions and effects.
* *Encapsulation*: Managing internal state such as health and mana within the class.
